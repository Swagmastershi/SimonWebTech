  			<h3>Avoid Debt</h3>
  			<h4>
  			<ol>
  				<li><b><u>Failing to Plan is Planning to Fail:</u></b> You need to keep a notebook
  				or a document to plan what payments need to get done at what point of time.
  				Set goals for each loans and credit card payments. If you stick to the plan,
  				you will be better off in the future.
  				</li>
  				<li><b><u>Always record your deposits and withdrawals:</u></b> When you purchase
  				something, record what you bought and how much money you spent. When your
  				paycheck from work came into the bank, record it. You will figure out your
  				monthly spending habit and know your limits on what you can buy.
  				</li>
  				<li><b><u>If you use credit card, be smart about it:</u></b> Try to use cash
  				whenever it is possible. That way, you will not have to worry about being in
  				debt. You will find out what you have to change in your spending habit
  				if you have to use a credit card every time you buy something.
  				</li>
  				<li><b><u>Stay within your spending limits:</u></b> If you think you can
  				not afford a product, ask yourself if you NEED it. If you need a car to
  				drive to work, would you want to show off your Lamborghini or use a car
  				that is good enough to get to work. There is a trade-off.
  				</li>
  				<li><b><u>Do not apply to more than 1 credit card at a time:</u></b> Stick
  				with one credit card and make a good standing on just that one card. There
  				is no need to search for another one. Just make a good credit history on
  				one card and if you need one later, then get one later.
  				</li>

  			<h3>Manage Debt</h3>
  			<h4>
  			<ol>
  				<li><b><u>Avoid eating at restaurants:</u></b> Restaurants are really
  				expensive because the food are delicious and you have to pay tips. Wait
  				until you have paid all of your debts. Then you can go ahead and have
  				a fancy meal. This will save you lots of money if you cook it yourself.
  				</li>
  				<li><b><u>Find entertainments in another way:</u></b> You want to spend
  				less money as possible on other things. So, you can cut down the cost of
  				going to the movies or paying to get into a paintball fight. Instead,
  				find cheap ways to have fun with your friends and families.
  				</li>
  				<li><b><u>Do not give up!:</u></b> Being in debt is really stressful but
  				you can not give up. Make a commitment and plan what you have to do to get
  				out of debt as soon as possible.
  				</li>
  				<li><b><u>Be patient:</u></b> Getting out of debt is a long and painful
  				process. But if you stick to the plan, slowly, your debt will be less.
  				You have to make sure you are making payments on time and start making
  				that a good habit.
  				</li>
  				<li><b><u>Extra money to use:</u></b> If you earned more money from work
  				from overtime or bonuses, use those money to pay some debt off. Those money
  				are not extra money to buy candies or junk food. Use it to pay more debt.
  				You will be better off.
  				</li>

				<h6><strong>MOTIVATION</strong></h6>
				
				<p>SimonWebTech was created because Simon wanted to learn how to develop website
					in January of 2015, his junior year of high school. The course he signed up for was Udemy's
					"Complete Web Developer Course" with Rob Percival. Percival's excellent teaching skills
					in the course allowed Simon to be inspired to be a web developer! Now, Simon wants to
					share what he likes to do in his free time!
